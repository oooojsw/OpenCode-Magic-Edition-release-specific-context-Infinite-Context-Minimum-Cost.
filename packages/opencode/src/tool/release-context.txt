Release tool context to save tokens. Use this tool when you have finished analyzing files or tool outputs and no longer need their full content in the conversation history.

IMPORTANT: Only completed tool calls can be released. If some tools are still running, this tool will automatically skip them and only release the completed ones.

This tool replaces tool output content with a placeholder containing:
- Tool name and title
- File size
- Number of tokens saved
- Release timestamp

Parameters:
- toolCallIds: (Optional) Array of specific tool call IDs to release. If not provided, auto-detects recent tool calls.
- count: (Optional) Number of recent tool calls to release. Default: 3. Only used if toolCallIds is not provided.
- tools: (Optional) Filter by tool names (e.g. ['read', 'grep']). Only release calls from these tools. Default: all tools.

Usage:
**Automatic Mode (Recommended):**
Simply call this tool without parameters to release the 3 most recent tool calls:
- release_context({})

Or specify how many to release:
- release_context({ count: 5 })

Or only release specific tool types:
- release_context({ tools: ['read'], count: 10 })

**Manual Mode:**
If you need to release specific tool calls, provide the toolCallId from the tool output.

When to use:
- After you have finished analyzing files' contents
- When you have extracted the necessary information from large outputs
- Before continuing with other tasks to reduce context size
- When you want to keep the conversation history clean

Example:
User: "Read these files and tell me the version numbers"
AI: [Reads 3 files, returns versions]
User: "Good, now release those files"
AI: [Calls release_context({})]
